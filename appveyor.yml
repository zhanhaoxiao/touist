# This AppVeyor configuration file has been writen to automate
# the building process and make deploying the application easy
# for the platform Windows.
#
# Like with the .travis.yml, this file will be executed
# by the appveyor servers and will build the project.
#
#
# To allow AppVeyor knowing when things are pushed to the github repo,
# the owner of the repo had to link the repo in the AppVeyor website.
#
# Debugging an appveyor build
# ===========================
# You can use Windows Remote Desktop (also available on mac os x) to debug
# a build (instead of commit-trying a hundred times); everything is explained
# in https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/rdp-to-build-worker/
#
# vim:set et sw=2 ts=2:

# Operating system (build VM template)
# It's a x64 VM. There is no way to force it to x86 apparently.
os: Windows Server 2012

# Scripts that are called at very beginning, before repo cloning
init:
  # With 'core.autocrlf true', all files are checkout out in CRLF mode, so
  # when menhir re-generates parser.messages (which will be produced with CRLF),
  # git status won't see any difference. But the thing is that all the shell
  # scripts (configure, appveyor-script.sh...) need to run under LF endings.
  # Solution: keep in 'input' (which checkouts in LF) and if a file is
  # re-generated (e.g., parser.messages) then dos2unix it.
  - git config --global core.autocrlf input

# I set the same behaviour as for in .travis.yml:
# the commiter will only be emailed if his commit failed
# to build.
#
# I removed the notifications: block. I expect AppVeyor to have
# this behavior by default:
# - If the commit fails, then send an email to the committer only.
# - If the commit previously failing now passes, do not send an email.
# - Do not send an email to anyone else
